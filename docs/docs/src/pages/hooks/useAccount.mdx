title: Using the useDisconnect Hook

# Using the useDisconnect Hook

The `useDisconnect` hook from StreamPay JS allows you to disconnect an already connected StreamPay or Solana wallet from your decentralized application (DApp).

## Installation

Before using the `useDisconnect` hook, make sure you have StreamPay JS installed in your project. If you haven't already, you can install it as follows:

```bash
npm install streampayjs
# or
yarn add streampayjs
```

## Usage

Once StreamPay JS is installed, you can use the `useDisconnect` hook in your DApp to provide users with the option to disconnect their wallets. Here's an example of how to use it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useDisconnect } from 'streampayjs'; // Make sure to import from the correct package

function MyDapp() {
  const { disconnect, isConnected } = useDisconnect();

  const disconnectWallet = async () => {
    try {
      await disconnect(); // Disconnect the wallet
      console.log('Wallet disconnected successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to disconnect wallet', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {isConnected ? (
        <div>
          <button onClick={disconnectWallet}>Disconnect Wallet</button>
          <p>Wallet is connected</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Wallet is not connected</p>
      )}
      {/* Your DApp content here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyDapp;
```

In the code above, we import the `useDisconnect` hook from the `streampayjs` package and use it to disconnect the wallet when the "Disconnect Wallet" button is clicked. We also display a message indicating whether the wallet is connected or not.

## Return Value

The `useDisconnect` hook returns an object with two properties:

- `disconnect`: This is a function that you can call to disconnect the wallet.
- `isConnected`: A boolean value indicating whether the wallet is currently connected or not.
