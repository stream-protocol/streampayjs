title: Using the useConnect Hook

# Using the useConnect Hook

The `useConnect` hook from StreamPay JS allows you to easily connect a StreamPay or Solana wallet to your decentralized application (DApp). This enables users to interact with your DApp using their wallets securely.

## Installation

Before using the `useConnect` hook, make sure you have StreamPay JS installed in your project. If you haven't already, you can install it as follows:

```bash
npm install streampayjs
# or
yarn add streampayjs
```

## Usage

Once StreamPay JS is installed, you can use the `useConnect` hook in your DApp. Here's an example of how to use it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useConnect } from 'streampayjs'; // Make sure to import from the correct package

function MyDapp() {
  const { connector: activeConnector, isConnected } = useConnect();

  const connectWallet = async () => {
    try {
      await activeConnector.connect(); // Connect the wallet
      console.log('Wallet connected successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to connect wallet', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
      {isConnected ? (
        <p>Wallet is connected</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Wallet is not connected</p>
      )}
      {/* Your DApp content here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyDapp;
```

In the code above, we import the `useConnect` hook from the `streampayjs` package and use it to connect the wallet when the "Connect Wallet" button is clicked. We also display a message indicating whether the wallet is connected or not.

## Return Value

The `useConnect` hook returns an object with two properties:

- `connector`: This is the active wallet connector that you can use to connect the wallet.
- `isConnected`: A boolean value indicating whether the wallet is currently connected or not.
