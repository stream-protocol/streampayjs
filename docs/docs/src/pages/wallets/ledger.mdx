# Ledger Wallet Integration

StreamPay JS provides a seamless way to connect the Ledger wallet to your decentralized application (DApp). By integrating Ledger, users can securely manage their crypto assets within your DApp.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating the Ledger wallet with your DApp, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [StreamPay JS](#link_to_streampayjs) installed in your project.

## Installation

To get started with Ledger wallet integration, follow these steps:

1. Install the Ledger Wallet package:

```bash
npm install ledger-wallet
# or
yarn add ledger-wallet
```

## Usage

After installing the Ledger Wallet package, you can connect it to your DApp. Here's a simple example of how to do it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Ledger } from 'streampayjs'; // Make sure to import from the correct package

function MyDapp() {
  const connectWallet = async () => {
    try {
      const wallet = new Ledger();
      await wallet.connect();
      console.log('Ledger wallet connected successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to connect Ledger wallet', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Ledger Wallet</button>
      {/* Your DApp content here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyDapp;
```

In the code above, we import the `Ledger` class from the `streampayjs` package and use it to connect the Ledger wallet when the "Connect Ledger Wallet" button is clicked.
