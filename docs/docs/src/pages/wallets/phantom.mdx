# Phantom Wallet Integration

StreamPay JS provides an easy way to connect the Phantom wallet to your decentralized application (DApp). By integrating Phantom, users can interact with your DApp securely and conveniently.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating the Phantom wallet with your DApp, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [StreamPay JS](#link_to_streampayjs) installed in your project.

## Installation

To begin integrating the Phantom wallet, follow these steps:

1. Install the Phantom Wallet package:

```bash
npm install phantom-wallet
# or
yarn add phantom-wallet
```

## Usage

Once you have Phantom Wallet installed, you can connect it to your DApp with ease. Here's an example of how to do it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PhantomWallet } from 'streampayjs'; // Make sure to import from the correct package

function MyDapp() {
  const connectWallet = async () => {
    try {
      const wallet = new PhantomWallet();
      await wallet.connect();
      console.log('Phantom wallet connected successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to connect Phantom wallet', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Phantom Wallet</button>
      {/* Your DApp content here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyDapp;
```

In the code above, we import the `PhantomWallet` class from the `streampayjs` package and use it to connect the Phantom wallet when the "Connect Phantom Wallet" button is clicked.
